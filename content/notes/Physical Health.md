Some advice on high performance. 

> I have to have socks for the current year. For example, the Tommy Hilfiger socks [that are part of the official Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team uniform] have to be of that year. They have to be Tommy and they can't be anything different, which I know sounds strange, but that's me!
>
> I also always go out to the pit wall with my water bottle, take it back, empty some water out and put in a Berocca, which is a vitamin pill. Itâ€™s something I've always done and always will do. Then, I'll go to the grid. 
> 
> There's a specific time when I set my IWC watch to the exact time of the day. It's just something I've always done to make sure that everything is in sequence. These are odd things to be admitting, but I always make sure I walk through the same side of the garage. They're all strange things I do out of habit, but they've worked!
