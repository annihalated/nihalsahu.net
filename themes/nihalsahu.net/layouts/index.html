    <p>The common theme in my work is trying to understand the structural, ideological, and personal factors that govern the behaviour of policymakers and judges.</p>

    <p>I try not to negatively characterize or attribute malice to anyone, and I try to remember that these people did not wake up in the morning with the intention of doing evil. If φ-ing will improve consistency in the legal system, cause the economy to grow faster, or improve administrative efficiency, why don’t policymakers φ? They must have some reason. They want the economy to grow faster.</p>
    <p>My critical skills are law, writing, research, project management, and software. In a different life, I wrote a lot of software every day. In this one, I write a little software every week to help with my research.</p>

    <p>These days, I’m working at Vidhi on health policy and pharmaceutical regulation. Opinions expressed on this site are my own.</p>
