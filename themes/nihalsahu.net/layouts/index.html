    <p>Trying to understand the structural, ideological, and personal factors that govern the behaviour of policymakers and judges. My critical skills are law, writing, research, project management, and software. In a different life, I wrote a lot of software every day. In this one, I write a little software every week to help with my research.</p>

    <p>These days, Iâ€™m working at Vidhi on health policy and pharmaceutical regulation.</p>
